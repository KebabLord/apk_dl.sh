## Why not ApkMirror?
Because apkmirror has cloudflare protection making it impossible to scrape the download url, without using a webdriver (bloat).
Uptodown on the other hand, is curl friendly.

## Is Uptodown secure?
Yes, in fact even more legit than apkmirror. It's actually a legit [company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/uptodown/) located in Spain. Also I compared the md5 hashes of some random app apks with the ones on apkmirror, they're the same.
